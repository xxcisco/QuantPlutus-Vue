# QuantDinger Frontend — multi-arch image published to GHCR.
#
# Stage 1 (builder) is pinned to --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM so the Vue build
# runs once natively on the host (typically linux/amd64 on GitHub Actions),
# NOT twice with the arm64 manifest entry forced through QEMU emulation
# (~5–10× slower). The build output (/app/dist) is pure static JS/CSS,
# byte-identical across architectures; the nginx stage just COPYs those
# files into each target arch's base image.
#
# Stage 2 (nginx) runs once per --platform target listed by buildx, but
# does no compilation — only file copies and a small apk add — so the
# arm64 manifest entry is cheap.
